To begin with we will start with a simple deployment using a docker http image.

`kubectl create deployment http --image=katacoda/docker-http-server:latest`{{execute}}

You can then use **kubectl** to view the status of the deployments

`kubectl get deployments`{{execute}}

To find out what Kubernetes created you can describe the deployment process.

`kubectl describe deployment http`{{execute}}

## Creating a service
With the deployment created, we can use **kubectl** to create a service which exposes the Pods on a particular port so that we can access it externally.

We can expose the container port `80` to the external port `8000` binding to the `external-ip` of the host.

We can expose our `http` deployment on port `80` by running `kubectl expose deployment http --external-ip="[[HOST_IP]]" --port=8000 --target-port=80`{{execute}}

You will then be able to ping the host and see the result from the HTTP service.

`curl http://[[HOST_IP]]:8000`{{execute}}

You can then see the response `<h1>This request was processed by host: http-768f8fdbc-fzqlr</h1>` where the **http-768f8fdbc-fzqlr** is replaced by the pod name found by running `kubectl get pods -l app=http`{{execute}}.

You should also now be able to see the new service under `kubectl get svc`{{execute}}.
